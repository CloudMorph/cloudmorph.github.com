CloudMorph
=====================

Cloud agnostic PaaS fabric

Cloud Morph project was envisioned to be a cross-platform PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service). It enables code to run in an abstract form and migrate between different clouds like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. This project allows cross-cloud workloads and leverages price fluctuations to take advantage of the cheapest resources available, which can significantly reduce costs for the organization. This projectâ€™s key features include automatic load balancing and failover to ensure high availability and performance, as well as the ability to abstract away infrastructure details to enable developers to focus on pure code development. Overall, this project was targeted to offer a highly scalable and cost-effective solution for running applications on cloud infrastructure.
